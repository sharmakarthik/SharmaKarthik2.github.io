										<h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
										<p>Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation technique that leverages the preferences and behaviors of multiple users to suggest new items. In this project, it was used to recommend movies by analyzing user ratings and drawing patterns from users with similar tastes. The key idea behind collaborative filtering is that if two users rate several movies similarly, the system can predict how one user would rate a movie the other has watched but not yet rated.</p>
										<p>There are two main types of collaborative filtering used in this project:<br/>
											User-Based Collaborative Filtering: This approach finds users who have rated movies in a similar way to the target user and recommends movies that those similar users have enjoyed.<br/>
											Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Here, the system finds similarities between movies based on user ratings and recommends movies that are rated similarly by users who liked a specific movie.<br/>
											By focusing on user-item interactions, collaborative filtering generates highly personalized movie suggestions, improving the user experience by recommending content that aligns with users' past behavior.</p>
										<h3> Fuzzy String Matching</h3>
										<p>In the content-based recommendation system, fuzzy string matching was employed to compare movie titles and genres. It allowed the system to handle user input flexibly by matching similar or slightly misspelled movie titles. This ensured that even vague or partial inputs would return relevant movie recommendations.</p>

											<h3>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</h3>
											<p>TF-IDF was used to prioritize important terms in movie descriptions and genres. It helped the content-based recommendation engine by assigning weights to words in the movie metadata, allowing the system to identify which movies have a strong relation to a userâ€™s search query or previously liked titles.</p>

											<h3>Matrix Factorization</h3>
											<p>Used within the collaborative filtering model, matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) helped decompose the large user-movie rating matrix into smaller, more manageable matrices. This improved the accuracy and performance of the recommender by discovering latent factors influencing movie preferences.
